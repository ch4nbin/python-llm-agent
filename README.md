AI Chatbot (LLM Agent)

An LLM-powered AI agent built with LangChain and LangGraph that streams real-time responses and dynamically calls Python tools (like a calculator).
This project uses OpenAI GPT models, UV for dependency management, and .env for secure API keys.

Features

LLM Agent Architecture – Uses create_react_agent to reason and act
Tool Calling – Dynamically invokes Python functions such as a calculator
Streaming Responses – Prints AI output token-by-token for a smoother chat experience
Environment-Secured API Keys – Managed with python-dotenv
Fast Dependency Management – Powered by UV

2. Install dependencies with UV
uv init
uv sync

3. Add your API key
Create a .env file in the project root:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

4. Run the chatbot
uv run main.py

Usage

Type a question or math query (e.g., What is 7+9?)
The agent decides whether to answer directly or use the calculator tool
Type quit to exit the chatbot
